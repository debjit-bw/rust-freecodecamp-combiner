# What's this?

This is a practice project to get familiar with Rust. The code is based on [this FreeCodeCamp video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsocPEZBd-M).

# What does this code do?

The code takes the paths of two images and path to an output image as its input. It crops the larger one to the smaller's size. Then it combines both (alternate pixels) to create one image, and outputs it to the chosen directory.

The video is a quality content, just like the rest of FreeCodeCamp. Highly recommended.
